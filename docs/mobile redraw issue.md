### Question to GPT:

```js
  DICE_COUNT_SELECT.onchange = () => {
    diceCollection.setDiceCount(DICE_COUNT_SELECT.value);
    SAVEDSTATE["dice_count"] = DICE_COUNT_SELECT.value;
    setToStorage(SAVEDSTATE);
  }
```

I have a slight problem with my code, this is linked to a select-option, my issue is with the behavior on a phone, where you can cycle through the various select options and hit "done" after various selections are made, so the "onchange" is different on phones, it doesn't trigger normally like it does on the pc browser, setDiceCount triggers a dom manipulation that seems to work, and the elements that are remade have classes attributed, some of which don't get acknowledged after hitting "done" on the phone

### Answer from GPT:

You're encountering a common issue on **mobile browsers**, particularly **iOS Safari** and **Android Chrome**, where the `onchange` event for a `<select>` element behaves differently:

### ✅ Desktop Behavior:

* Every change to the `<select>` triggers `onchange` immediately.

### ❌ Mobile Behavior:

* The user can scroll through options, but `onchange` only fires when they hit **“Done”** or tap away — **and** only if the final value is **different from the original**.
* Additionally, there might be **timing issues** with DOM manipulations right after `onchange` because the repaint/reflow timing on mobile is different.

### 🛠️ Recommended Fixes

#### ✅ Option 1: Use `requestAnimationFrame` (best for DOM update delay issues)

Wrap your logic in a `requestAnimationFrame()` or `setTimeout()` to let the browser finish its internal select-menu handling before your code runs.

```js
DICE_COUNT_SELECT.onchange = () => {
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    diceCollection.setDiceCount(DICE_COUNT_SELECT.value);
    SAVEDSTATE["dice_count"] = DICE_COUNT_SELECT.value;
    setToStorage(SAVEDSTATE);
  });
};
```

This ensures the DOM is fully updated before your manipulation triggers (especially class-based logic).

---

#### ✅ Option 2: Use `blur` or `focusout` (catch exit from mobile select menu)

Add an additional event listener:

```js
DICE_COUNT_SELECT.addEventListener('blur', () => {
  diceCollection.setDiceCount(DICE_COUNT_SELECT.value);
  SAVEDSTATE["dice_count"] = DICE_COUNT_SELECT.value;
  setToStorage(SAVEDSTATE);
});
```

This can act as a fallback when `onchange` doesn’t behave as expected.

---

#### ✅ Option 3: Check `input` event (some mobile browsers trigger this)

Not all mobile browsers fire `input` on `select`, but it can be useful as a backup:

```js
DICE_COUNT_SELECT.addEventListener('input', () => {
  diceCollection.setDiceCount(DICE_COUNT_SELECT.value);
  SAVEDSTATE["dice_count"] = DICE_COUNT_SELECT.value;
  setToStorage(SAVEDSTATE);
});
```

### 🧪 Extra Tips

* After `setDiceCount`, if you manipulate the DOM and expect certain elements to have classes, **double-check the lifecycle timing**. You might want to run class-based logic in a `setTimeout(…, 0)` or in a `MutationObserver` if it's fragile.
* Inspect mobile behavior using **remote device debugging** (e.g., Safari’s Web Inspector or Chrome DevTools with Android).

Let me know if you want help wrapping this into a reusable `initSelectHandler()` function or need a mutation fallback for tracking DOM updates.
